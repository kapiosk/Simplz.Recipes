# Base Risotto

Hint: Risotto is more of a pasta dish than a rice dish, the magic sauce is essentially an emulsion of water and fat, stabilised by the amylopectin of the short grain rice. With this in mind butter is a good friend, as it provides both water and fat (1:9), has a mild taste, and helps both with the emulsion and also with the smoother integration of the cheese.

## Ingredients (Approx per volume):
- 1 cup short grain rice (Carnaroli, Carolina, Arborio)
- 3.5 cups water (or 3 cups stock + 0.5 cup dry white wine)
- 1/6 cup fat (oil or butter, for coating the grains)
- 1/3 cup fat (preferably butter, changes depending on cheese)
- 1/2 cup finely grated dry cheese (Parmesan)
- Salt/pepper/nutmeg to taste
- Optional: Handful of chopped dried shiitake mushrooms

## Instructions:

1. Drop the rice and 1/6 cup fat into a saucepan set on medium heat. Stir until the grains are covered.

2. Turn the heat to high, pour in your liquid, starting with the water base, and then, if available, the alcohol. Add salt if needed. (Final 0.5 cup can be added now or later depending on your preferences)

3. If using, add the optional chopped dried shiitake mushrooms.

4. Stir until it starts to boil. Reduce the heat to just under simmer and leave it there based on package recommendations or until the rice has absorbed most of the water and has softened.

5. Add your final fat, stir until homogenized. Then, drop in the cheese, followed by the rest of the spices to taste. Adjust salt, pepper, and nutmeg as needed.

Enjoy your delicious base risotto!
